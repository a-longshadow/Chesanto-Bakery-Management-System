#### 📝 Notes
```
[2025-10-27 12:05] Inventory App Creation
- Created 10 models (~800 lines) with comprehensive business logic
- Design patterns implemented:
  ✓ Soft delete (is_active flags)
  ✓ Audit trail (created_by, updated_by timestamps)
  ✓ Auto-calculation (costs, totals, alerts)
  ✓ Approval workflow (WastageRecord > KES 500)
  ✓ Color-coded status indicators in admin
  ✓ Inline editing (PurchaseItemInline)
  ✓ Smart alerts (7-day supply threshold)

[2025-10-27 12:05] Business Logic
- Auto-calculate: cost_per_recipe_unit = cost_per_purchase_unit / conversion_factor
- Auto-calculate: low_stock_alert when current_stock < reorder_level
- Auto-calculate: PurchaseItem.total_cost = quantity × unit_cost
- Auto-calculate: Purchase.total_amount from all purchase items
- Auto-stock update: When Purchase.status = 'RECEIVED' → add to InventoryItem.current_stock
- Approval requirement: WastageRecord requires CEO approval if cost > KES 500

[2025-10-27 12:17] Data Seeding Complete
- Created seed_inventory management command (idempotent)
- Seeded 5 expense categories
- Seeded 6 unit conversions
- Seeded 20 inventory items with:
  • Wheat Flour: 500 kg stock, KES 73/kg (from KES 3,650 per 50kg bag)
  • Sugar: 100 kg stock, KES 144/kg
  • Cooking Oil: 80 L stock, KES 237/L (from KES 4,740 per 20L jerycan)
  • Yeast (Standard): 2.7 kg stock, KES 0.6/g
  • Yeast (2-in-1): 1.8 kg stock, KES 0.9/g
  • Packaging Bags: 5,000 pcs bread, 3,000 KDF, 2,000 scones @ KES 3.3 each
  • All items with 7-day reorder levels configured
```
**Phase:** 1 of 4  
**Duration:** Week 1-2  
**Started:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** 🚀 Starting

## 🔗 Day 5: Products ↔ Inventory Integration

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Objective:** Enable auto-cost calculations from Inventory to Mix costs

### ✅ Completed Tasks

- [x] Uncommented `Ingredient.inventory_item` FK in products/models.py
- [x] Created migration 0002_ingredient_inventory_item.py
- [x] Applied migration successfully
- [x] Updated seed_products command to link ingredients to inventory items
- [x] All 10 ingredients linked to corresponding inventory items

#### 2. Auto-Cost Calculation Implementation

- [x] Added unit conversion logic (kg↔g, L↔mL)
- [x] Auto-pulls `cost_per_recipe_unit` from linked InventoryItem
- [x] Integrated with `save()` method for automatic cost updates
- [x] Updated `Mix.calculate_costs()` to aggregate ingredient costs

#### 3. Cost Recalculation
- [x] Created `recalculate_costs` management command

- [x] All costs updated successfully (21/21 ingredients)

#### 4. Verification & Analysis
- [x] Created `show_costs` management command for profitability analysis
- [x] Verified all cost calculations accurate
- [x] Generated profitability reports for all products

### 📊 Cost Analysis Results

**Bread Mix 1:**
- Total Cost: KES 4,234.20 (was KES 36.00 before integration)
- Cost per Loaf: KES 32.08
- Selling Price: KES 60.00
- Profit per Loaf: KES 27.92 (46.5% margin)
- Expected Output: 132 loaves
- Total Profit (if all sold): KES 3,685.80

**KDF Mix 1:**
- Total Cost: KES 6,374.90 (was KES 20.40 before integration)
- Cost per Packet: KES 59.58
- Selling Price: KES 100.00
- Profit per Packet: KES 40.42 (40.4% margin)
- Expected Output: 107 packets
- Total Profit (if all sold): KES 4,325.10

**Scones Mix 1:**
- Total Cost: KES 3,247.60 (was KES 30.00 before integration)
- Cost per Packet: KES 31.84
- Selling Price: KES 50.00
- Profit per Packet: KES 18.16 (36.3% margin)
- Expected Output: 102 packets
- Total Profit (if all sold): KES 1,852.40

**Overall Daily Production Potential:**
- Total Revenue: KES 23,720.00
- Total Costs: KES 13,856.70
- Total Profit: KES 9,863.30
- Overall Margin: 41.6%

### 🔧 New Management Commands

1. **`recalculate_costs`** - Recalculates all mix costs from inventory
   - Usage: `python manage.py recalculate_costs`
   - Run after inventory price changes or ingredient linking
   - Updates 21 mix ingredients across 3 mixes

2. **`show_costs`** - Displays comprehensive cost analysis
   - Usage: `python manage.py show_costs`
   - Shows production details, cost breakdown, pricing, profitability
   - Includes overall daily production potential

### 📝 Technical Implementation Details

**Unit Conversion Logic:**
```python
# Handles kg↔g and L↔mL conversions automatically
- kg to g: multiply by 1000
- g to kg: divide by 1000
- L to mL: multiply by 1000
- mL to L: divide by 1000
```

**Auto-Cost Flow:**
```
InventoryItem.cost_per_recipe_unit
    ↓ (linked via Ingredient.inventory_item)
MixIngredient.calculate_cost()
    ↓ (quantity × cost_per_unit with unit conversion)
MixIngredient.ingredient_cost
    ↓ (aggregated by Mix.calculate_costs())
Mix.total_cost & Mix.cost_per_packet
```

### 🎯 Integration Benefits

1. **Automated Costing**: No manual cost entry for mixes
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Inventory price changes auto-reflect in mix costs
3. **Accurate Profitability**: Precise profit margins for business decisions
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete cost history via inventory tracking
5. **Unit Flexibility**: Automatic unit conversions (kg/g, L/mL)

### 📄 Files Modified
