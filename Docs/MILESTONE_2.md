## üì¶ 1. Products App

### Terminology
- **KDF**: Pieces (12 = 1 packet), Variable output 98-107, Hand-cut
- **Bread**: Loaves (1 = 1 packet), Fixed output, Machine-weighed
  - **Bread Rejects**: Sub-product, variable pricing (default KES 50/loaf)
- **Scones**: Pieces (12 = 1 packet), Fixed output, Machine-weighed

**Note:** Product pricing, variance ranges, and titles are Super Admin configurable (not hardcoded)

### Data Flow
```
INVENTORY (Ingredients) ‚Üí MIX (Recipe) ‚Üí PRODUCT (Bread/KDF/Scones)
```
**Key Concept**: Mixes consume ingredients from Inventory to produce Products.

### Models
```python
Product: 
    name (‚úèÔ∏è Super Admin editable), 
    alias (‚úèÔ∏è Super Admin editable), 
    units_per_packet, 
    price_per_packet (KES - ‚úèÔ∏è Super Admin editable), 
    has_variable_output (bool),
    min_expected_output (‚úèÔ∏è Super Admin editable - e.g., 98 for KDF),
    max_expected_output (‚úèÔ∏è Super Admin editable - e.g., 107 for KDF),
    has_sub_product (bool - e.g., True for Bread with Rejects),
    sub_product_name (e.g., "Bread Rejects"),
    sub_product_price (KES - ‚úèÔ∏è Super Admin editable, default 50),
    is_active (bool), 
    created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at

Ingredient: 
    name, default_unit, inventory_item (FK to InventoryItem),
    is_active (bool), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at

Mix: 
    product (FK), name, version, expected_packets, is_active (bool),
    total_cost (ü§ñ calculated - sum of all MixIngredients), 
    cost_per_packet (ü§ñ calculated - total_cost / expected_packets),
    created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at

MixIngredient: 
    mix (FK), ingredient (FK), 
    quantity (‚úèÔ∏è manual - e.g., 36, 4.5, 2.8), 
    unit (‚úèÔ∏è manual - kg, g, L),
    ingredient_cost (ü§ñ auto from Inventory - quantity √ó cost_per_unit),
    created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at
```

**4. Cost Auto-fill Behavior:**
```
User selects "Bread Mix 1"
‚Üì
System loads 7 MixIngredients:
  - Flour: 36 kg √ó KES 73/kg (from Inventory) = KES 2,628
  - Sugar: 4.5 kg √ó KES 144/kg (from Inventory) = KES 648
  - [... etc for all ingredients]
‚Üì
Total Mix Cost: KES 4,224.38 (auto-calculated)
Cost per Loaf: KES 32.00 (auto-calculated)
```

**5. When to Recalculate:**
- Ingredient quantity changed ‚Üí recalculate ingredient_cost
- Ingredient added/removed ‚Üí recalculate total_cost
- Inventory price updated ‚Üí recalculate all mixes using that ingredient
- Expected packets changed ‚Üí recalculate cost_per_packet

# Automatic calculation when ProductionBatch is saved:
ProductionBatch.packaging_cost = packets_produced √ó packaging_bag_cost (KES 3.3)

# Example from screenshots:
Bread (8 mixes): 1,056 loaves √ó KES 3.3 = KES 3,484.80
KDF: 832 packets √ó KES 3.3 = KES 2,745.60
Scones: 612 packets √ó KES 3.3 = KES 2,019.60

## üè≠ 3. Production App

### Features
- Daily batch tracking
- **Opening/closing PRODUCT stock tracking (finished goods: Bread, KDF, Scones)**
- **P&L per mix** (CEO requirement)
- Auto-deduct inventory (raw materials)
- Cost calculations
- **Permission Level**: Accountant or higher can adjust production records

### Product Stock Flow Logic
```
OPENING PRODUCT STOCK (per product) = Previous day's closing product stock
  ‚Üì
+ PRODUCTION (from mixes today)
  ‚Üì
- DISPATCH (sent to salesmen/schools/depots)
  ‚Üì
+ RETURNS (from salesmen/schools/depots)
  ‚Üì
= CLOSING PRODUCT STOCK (per product)
```

**Alternative calculation:**
```
CLOSING PRODUCT STOCK = (Opening + Production) - Dispatched + Returns
                      = Not Dispatched + Returns
```

### Permission Matrix
| Action | Production Staff | Accountant | Admin/CEO |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| View batches | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Add batch | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Edit batch (before closing) | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Edit batch (after closing) | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Adjust indirect costs | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Close daily production | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Reopen closed day | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

### Inputs/Outputs
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Manual (Accountant+)**: Mixes produced, actual units/packets, indirect costs (diesel, firewood, electricity, fuel)
- ü§ñ **Auto**: Opening stock (from previous closing), ingredient costs (from Inventory), expected yields, variance calculations, P&L calculations, cost allocations
- **Output**: Production batches, P&L per mix, opening/closing stock, daily production summary

### Business Rules
1. **Product Configuration (‚úèÔ∏è Super Admin Editable)**:
   - Product names, aliases, titles
   - Selling prices (Bread: KES 60, KDF: KES 100, Scones: KES 50, Bread Rejects: KES 50)
   - Variance ranges (KDF: 98-107, Bread/Scones: fixed output)
   - Sub-product pricing (Bread Rejects: variable, default KES 50)
2. **Variance Tracking**: 
   - KDF: Variable output 98-107 packets (‚úèÔ∏è range adjustable by Super Admin)
   - Bread: Fixed output + Rejects sub-product
   - Scones: Fixed output
3. **Bread Rejects Handling**:
   - Count toward total production
   - Sold at reduced price (default KES 50, ‚úèÔ∏è Super Admin editable)
   - Tracked separately in dispatch and sales
   - Same packaging cost (KES 3.3/bag)
4. **Indirect Cost Allocation**: Daily indirect costs divided across all batches proportionally by total_cost
5. **Packaging Auto-deduction**: 
   - Bread: 1 bag per loaf (132 loaves = 132 bags @ KES 3.3 = KES 435.60)
   - Bread Rejects: 1 bag per loaf @ KES 3.3
   - KDF: 1 bag per packet (107 packets = 107 bags @ KES 3.3 = KES 353.10)
   - Scones: 1 bag per packet (102 packets = 102 bags @ KES 3.3 = KES 336.60)
   - Django signal deducts bags from Inventory when ProductionBatch saved
6. **Opening Product Stock**: ü§ñ Auto-calculated from previous day's closing product stock
7. **Closing Product Stock**: ü§ñ Auto-calculated = Opening + Production - Dispatched + Returns
8. **Stock Reconciliation Rule (What Comes In Must Go Out - Enhanced)**:
   ```
   INVENTORY (Raw Materials):
   Opening Stock + Purchases = Usage in Production + Damage/Wastage + Closing Stock
   
   PRODUCTS (Finished Goods):
   Opening Stock + Production = Dispatched - Returns + Damage/Expired + Closing Stock
   
   DISPATCH/SALES:
   What Goes Out (Dispatch) = Sales + Returns
   ```
   
   **Damage/Wastage Tracking:**
   - **New Model: StockDamage** (tracks all losses separately)
     ```python
     StockDamage:
         item (FK - InventoryItem or Product),
         item_type (INVENTORY/PRODUCT),
         quantity,
         damage_reason (SPOILAGE/SPILL/EXPIRED/CONTAMINATION/PEST/THEFT/BREAKAGE/OTHER),
         damage_date,
         value_lost (KES - calculated),
         recorded_by,
         approved_by (FK - User, null=True),
         approval_required (bool - True if > KES 500),
         is_approved (bool),
         notes,
         created_at
     ```
   - **Approval Workflow**:
     - Accountant+ can record damage
     - CEO must approve if value > KES 500
     - Unapproved damages flagged in reconciliation report
   - **Damage Reasons**:
     - SPOILAGE: Food gone bad, mold
     - SPILL: Liquid ingredients spilled during handling
     - EXPIRED: Past best-before date
     - CONTAMINATION: Cross-contamination, foreign objects
     - PEST: Rodent/insect damage
     - THEFT: Missing stock (suspected theft)
     - BREAKAGE: Dropped, crushed products
     - OTHER: Specify in notes
   - **Variance Alert**: If variance > 5% after accounting for damages ‚Üí Investigation
   - **Monthly Report**: Total damages by category, trends, prevention recommendations
9. **Book Closing**: At 9PM daily, `is_closed=True`, Accountant locked out (only CEO/Admin can edit)
10. **Time-Aware Permissions** (Defense-in-Depth):
    ```python
    def can_edit_production(user, production_date):
        if production_date < timezone.now().date():
            # Past date
            if user.role in ['CEO', 'ADMIN']:
                return True  # CEO/Admin can always edit
            elif user.role == 'ACCOUNTANT' and timezone.now().hour < 21:
                return True  # Accountant can edit before 9PM
            else:
                return False  # Locked after 9PM for Accountant
        return True  # Today's production - anyone authorized can edit
    ```
    - **Hybrid Approach**: Cron closes books at 9PM + Permission layer prevents late edits
    - **Why Both?**: Cron ensures reports go out, permissions prevent accidental edits if cron fails
11. **Next Day Opening**: When new DailyProduction created ‚Üí opening_product_stock auto-loads from previous closing_product_stock
12. **Auto-deduction**: When ProductionBatch saved ‚Üí Django signal deducts ingredients + packaging bags from Inventory (raw materials)

### Dispatch Workflow

**Step 1: Accountant Creates Dispatch** (‚úèÔ∏è Manual)
```
Salesperson: John Doe (SALESMAN)
Products dispatched:
  - Bread: 50 loaves @ KES 32 cost = KES 1,600 expected @ KES 60 selling = KES 3,000
  - KDF: 30 packets @ KES 59.52 cost = KES 1,785.60 expected @ KES 60 selling = KES 1,800
  - Scones: 20 packets @ KES 31.04 cost = KES 620.80 expected @ KES 60 selling = KES 1,200
Crates: 5 crates dispatched
Total Expected Revenue: KES 6,000
```

**Step 2: Salesman Returns** (‚úèÔ∏è Manual entry by Accountant)
```
Returns:
  - Bread: 5 loaves returned, 45 sold
  - KDF: 3 packets returned, 27 sold
  - Scones: 2 packets returned, 18 sold
Crates: 5 returned, 0 deficit
Cash: KES 5,400 returned
```

**Step 3: System Calculates** (ü§ñ Auto)
```
BREAD:
  - Sold: 45 loaves √ó KES 60 = KES 2,700
  - Commission: 45 √ó KES 5 = KES 225
  - Net Sales: KES 2,700 - KES 225 = KES 2,475

KDF:
  - Sold: 27 packets √ó KES 60 = KES 1,620
  - Commission: 27 √ó KES 5 = KES 135
  - Net Sales: KES 1,620 - KES 135 = KES 1,485

SCONES:
  - Sold: 18 packets √ó KES 60 = KES 1,080
  - Commission: 18 √ó KES 5 = KES 90
  - Net Sales: KES 1,080 - KES 90 = KES 990

TOTALS:
  - Gross Sales: KES 5,400
  - Per-unit Commission: KES 450

## üìÑ 6. Reports App

### Report Storage Strategy

**Key Concept:** Books are closed daily ‚Üí Data is permanent ‚Üí Store once, view many times

**Why Store Reports?**
- ‚úÖ Books locked at 9PM (data won't change)
- ‚úÖ Fast retrieval (no recalculation)
- ‚úÖ Historical audit trail
- ‚úÖ Can re-send emails anytime
- ‚úÖ Secure access (requires login)

### Email Strategy: Link to Report (Not Full Content)

**Problem:** Sending full HTML tables in email is clunky, charts don't work

**Solution:** Email contains **summary + secure link** to view full report in app

**Email Example:**
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation Strategy

### Railway Cron + Django Signals

**Why This Approach:**
- ‚≠ê **Zero additional packages** - Railway native feature + Django built-in
- ‚≠ê **Zero infrastructure** - No Redis, no message queues, no workers
- ‚≠ê **Zero additional cost** - Included in Railway
- ‚≠ê **Simple debugging** - Management commands run like any Django command
- ‚≠ê **Perfect for scheduled tasks** - Daily/weekly/monthly reports, book closing
- ‚≠ê **Perfect for immediate alerts** - Django signals fire instantly
- ‚≠ê **Easy maintenance** - Standard Django patterns

**What We're Using:**
1. **Railway Cron** ‚Üí Scheduled tasks (reports, book closing, stock checks)
2. **Django Signals** ‚Üí Immediate alerts (low stock, deficits, reconciliation)
3. **Django Email** ‚Üí Built-in email sending (no external service)

---

### Railway Cron Configuration

**File:** `railway.json` (in project root)
```json
{
  "cron": [
    {
      "schedule": "0 20 * * *",
      "command": "python manage.py close_daily_books",
      "name": "Close Daily Books & Generate Report"
    },
    {
      "schedule": "0 8 * * 0",
      "command": "python manage.py generate_weekly_report",
      "name": "Weekly Report (Sunday 8AM)"
    },
    {
      "schedule": "0 0 1 * *",
      "command": "python manage.py generate_monthly_report",
      "name": "Monthly Report (1st 12AM)"
    },
    {
      "schedule": "0 8 * * *",
      "command": "python manage.py check_stock_levels",
      "name": "Daily Stock Level Check (8AM)"

---

### Django Signals (Immediate Alerts)

**Trigger:** Instant (when data changes)  
**No queue needed** - Runs synchronously in same request

```python
# Inventory Alert (Low Stock)
@receiver(post_save, sender=ProductionBatch)
def check_inventory_after_production(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    """Triggers immediately when batch saved"""
    for ingredient in instance.mix.ingredients:
        if ingredient.current_stock < ingredient.calculated_alert_level:
            send_mail(
                subject=f'‚ö†Ô∏è Low Stock: {ingredient.name}',
                message=f'Only {ingredient.current_stock} remaining',
                recipient_list=['accountant@chesanto.com']
            )

# Deficit Alert (High Revenue Loss)
@receiver(post_save, sender=SalesReturn)
def check_deficit_alert(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    """Triggers immediately when return saved"""
    if instance.revenue_deficit > 500:
        send_mail(
            subject=f'üö® HIGH DEFICIT: {instance.salesperson.name}',
            message=f'Deficit: KES {instance.revenue_deficit}',
            recipient_list=['ceo@chesanto.com', 'accountant@chesanto.com']
        )

# Inventory Deduction (Auto-update Stock)
@receiver(post_save, sender=ProductionBatch)
def deduct_inventory(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    """Auto-deduct ingredients + packaging when batch created"""
    if created:
        for mix_ingredient in instance.mix.mixingredient_set.all():
            StockMovement.objects.create(
                item=mix_ingredient.ingredient.inventory_item,
                movement_type='PRODUCTION_USE',
                quantity=-mix_ingredient.quantity,
                reference_type='ProductionBatch',
                reference_id=instance.id
            )

# Stock Reconciliation (Daily Variance Check)
@receiver(post_save, sender=DailyProduction)
def check_stock_reconciliation(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    """Check if opening + production = dispatched + closing"""
    if instance.is_closed:
        expected_closing = (
            instance.opening_product_stock_bread + 
            instance.bread_produced - 
            instance.bread_dispatched + 
            instance.bread_returned
        )
        if expected_closing != instance.closing_product_stock_bread:
            variance = abs(expected_closing - instance.closing_product_stock_bread)
            if variance / expected_closing > 0.05:  # 5% threshold
                send_mail(
                    subject='‚ö†Ô∏è Stock Reconciliation Variance',
                    message=f'Bread variance: {variance} loaves (5%+)',
                    recipient_list=['accountant@chesanto.com']
                )
```

**Alert Types:**
- ‚úÖ **Low stock** ‚Üí Immediate (after production)
- ‚úÖ **Deficit** ‚Üí Immediate (after sales return)
- ‚úÖ **Inventory deduction** ‚Üí Immediate (after production)
- ‚úÖ **Stock variance** ‚Üí Immediate (at book closing)

---

## üîê System Configuration

### Alert Thresholds (Admin Configurable)

**Inventory Alerts:**
- **Default**: Alert when stock < 7 days of production
- **Calculation**: 
  ```python
  weekly_usage = sum(last_4_weeks_usage) / 4
  alert_threshold = weekly_usage √ó alert_threshold_days (default: 7)
  
  if current_stock < alert_threshold:
      send_alert()  # Email + Dashboard notification
  ```
- **Admin Override**: Super Admin can set custom threshold per item (e.g., Flour = 10 days, Salt = 14 days)

**Deficit Alerts:**
- Revenue deficit > KES 0 ‚Üí Accountant
- Revenue deficit > KES 500 ‚Üí Accountant + CEO
- Crate deficit > 0 ‚Üí Immediate (SMS + Email)
- Pattern: Same salesperson 3+ deficits/month ‚Üí Flag for review

**Stock Reconciliation Alerts:**
- Daily variance check at book closing (9PM)
- Inventory: Opening + Purchases ‚â† Usage + Closing ‚Üí Alert
- Products: Opening + Production ‚â† Dispatched - Returns + Closing ‚Üí Alert
- Variance > 5% ‚Üí Immediate investigation required

---

## üíæ Backup & Recovery Strategy

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Railway File System Limitation
**Railway uses ephemeral/read-only file systems** - files saved locally are lost on restart/deploy.

**Solution:** Store backups in **DATABASE** (PostgreSQL has plenty of space) + **Email delivery**

### Database Backups (In-Database Storage)

**Model for Backup Storage:**
```python
DatabaseBackup:
    backup_date (date),
    backup_type (DAILY/MANUAL),
    
    # Compressed Data (stored as binary/text)
    backup_data (TextField - JSON compressed),
    backup_size (bytes),
    
    # Metadata
    tables_included (JSON - list of table names),
    record_counts (JSON - {"products": 15, "inventory": 42, ...}),
    
    # Email delivery
    emailed_to (email addresses - comma separated),
    email_sent_at (timestamp),
    
    created_by, created_at
```

**Backup Strategy:**
- **Retention**: Keep only **2 most recent daily backups** (avoid data overload)
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL database (as compressed JSON text)
- **Schedule**: Daily at 2:00 AM (Railway cron)
- **Auto-cleanup**: Delete oldest when creating 3rd backup

**Backup Workflow:**
```python
# Management command: python manage.py create_database_backup

1. Query all critical tables:
   - Products, Inventory, Production, Sales, Accounting, Payroll
   
2. Serialize to JSON and compress (gzip):
   backup_data = gzip.compress(json.dumps(all_data))
   
3. Store in DatabaseBackup model:
   - Keep only 2 most recent
   - Delete oldest: DatabaseBackup.objects.order_by('created_at')[2:].delete()
   
4. Email compressed backup to CEO + Developer:
   - Attachment: backup-2025-10-25.json.gz
   - Size: ~500KB compressed (even with months of data)
   
5. Also store in DB for web-based restore
```

**Restore Options:**

**Option 1: Web-Based Restore** (Recommended)
```
Admin Dashboard ‚Üí System ‚Üí Database Backups
- View list of 2 most recent backups
- Click "Restore from this backup"
- Confirm ‚Üí System restores data
- Verify data integrity
```

**Option 2: Email-Based Restore**
```
1. CEO/Admin downloads backup-2025-10-25.json.gz from email
2. Upload via Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Restore from File
3. System decompresses and imports
4. Verify data integrity
```

**Option 3: Management Command** (Direct PostgreSQL access)
```bash
# If you have Railway CLI access to production database
python manage.py restore_from_backup --backup-id=123
# OR
python manage.py restore_from_file --file=/path/to/backup.json.gz
```

### Data Exports (On-Demand)

**CSV Exports (Lighter Weight):**
- All reports exportable to CSV
- Admin can export specific data:
  - Current inventory stock
  - Monthly sales data
  - Payroll for specific month
  - Production batches
- Format: UTF-8, Excel-compatible
- Download immediately (no file storage needed)
- Optional: Email to recipient

**HTML Report Archives:**
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly reports already stored in database
- Can be re-sent via email anytime
- Searchable by date range
- Export: Generate ZIP in memory, download immediately (no file save)

**Manual Backup Workflow:**
```
Admin Dashboard ‚Üí System Settings ‚Üí Backup & Export
Options:
  1. Create Database Backup Now (immediate ‚Üí email + DB storage)
  2. Export Current Data (CSV bundle ‚Üí download)
  3. Export Reports (HTML bundle ‚Üí download)
  4. Email Latest Backup
```

### Backup Storage Summary

**What's Stored WHERE:**
- ‚úÖ **In PostgreSQL DB**: 
  - 2 most recent full backups (compressed JSON)
  - All daily/weekly/monthly reports (HTML)
  - All operational data
  
- ‚úÖ **In Email Archives** (CEO + Developer):
  - Daily backup attachments (kept in email)
  - Weekly/Monthly reports (HTML)
  
- ‚ùå **NOT on Railway File System**: 
  - No local files (ephemeral - would be lost)
  
### Recovery Procedures

**Full System Restore (Disaster Recovery):**
```
1. Access Admin Dashboard (or Railway PostgreSQL console)
2. Go to System ‚Üí Database Backups
3. Select most recent backup (or upload from email)
4. Click "Restore"
5. System confirms: "Restore will overwrite current data"
6. Proceed ‚Üí Data restored
7. Run integrity checks:
   - python manage.py check_data_integrity
   - Verify stock reconciliation
   - Check last 3 days of reports
```

**Partial Restore (Specific Data):**
```
1. Download backup from email or database
2. Extract specific table data (e.g., inventory)
3. Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Select table
4. Upload CSV or JSON
5. System validates and imports
```

**Data Verification Post-Restore:**
- Auto-run reconciliation checks:
  - Inventory: Opening + Purchases = Usage + Closing
  - Products: Opening + Production = Dispatched - Returns + Closing
  - Sales: What went out = Sales + Returns
- Generate test daily report
- Compare totals with last known good state

---

## ÔøΩüì± Responsive Design Strategy

### Desktop Priority (Complex Data/Graphs)

**Primary Focus:** Desktop/Laptop browsers (1024px+ width)
- Wide tables for production batches, sales returns, payroll
- Complex graphs with multiple data points
- Side-by-side comparisons
- Full-width dashboards

**Why Desktop First:**
- Finance/accounting work requires large screens
- Complex data entry (mixes, purchases, payroll)
- Multiple columns in reports (P&L statements)
- Graph readability (8 charts on Analytics dashboard)

### Mobile-Friendly Basics (Bootstrap Responsive)

**Where Mobile Works:**
- Login/logout
- View simple lists (products, salespeople, inventory items)
- Basic dashboards (summary cards)
- Alerts/notifications
- Single-product dispatch/return entry

**Mobile Limitations (Acceptable):**
- Complex tables may require horizontal scroll
- Graphs may stack vertically
- Multi-product dispatch entry easier on desktop
- Report viewing optimized for desktop

**Technical Approach:**
- Bootstrap 5 grid system (responsive by default)
- Media queries for key breakpoints (768px, 1024px)
- Mobile: Stack cards, simplified navigation
- Desktop: Full-width tables, side-by-side panels

## ‚úÖ Business Rules (Answered)

1. **Indirect Costs**: Per day (allocated across all batches)
2. **Commission**: Variable per salesman (0% schools, 5-10% salesmen)
3. **Deficits**: Flag + immediate alert (no auto-deduction)
4. **Schools vs Salesmen**: Same workflow, different commission
5. **Pricing**: Locked at day start (changes next day)

```

### Chart.js Features (FREE) ‚úÖ SELECTED
- 8 chart types: Line, Bar, Pie, Doughnut, Radar, Polar, Bubble, Scatter
- Responsive & animated by default
- Tooltips & legends built-in
- No server-side dependencies
- MIT License (completely free)
- Size: 11kb gzipped (auto-compressed during CDN download)

### Email System (Django Built-in)
```python
# settings/prod.py
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'  # Or Railway SMTP
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_USER')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_PASSWORD')
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'Chesanto Bakery <alerts@chesanto.com>'
```

### Railway Configuration (Cron + Backups)
```json
// railway.json - Scheduled tasks
{
  "cron": [
    {
      "schedule": "0 20 * * *",
      "command": "python manage.py close_daily_books",
      "name": "Close Daily Books & Generate Report"
    },
    {
      "schedule": "0 8 * * 0",
      "command": "python manage.py generate_weekly_report",
      "name": "Weekly Report (Sunday 8AM)"
    },
    {
      "schedule": "0 0 1 * *",
      "command": "python manage.py generate_monthly_report",
      "name": "Monthly Report (1st 12AM)"
    },
    {
      "schedule": "0 8 * * *",
      "command": "python manage.py check_stock_levels",
      "name": "Daily Stock Level Check"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Railway PostgreSQL Backups (FREE):**
- Automatic daily backups (Railway native feature)
- Keep 2 latest backups
- Restore via Railway dashboard or CLI
- No additional packages needed

### Report Delivery Strategy
- **Email:** Summary + secure link to view full report
- **Report page:** Tables (stored data) + Charts (Chart.js renders on-demand)
- **Charts:** Only work in web browser (not in email)
- **Security:** Requires login to view reports

### NOT Using (Complexity Avoided) ‚ùå
- ‚ùå **Background task queues** (Celery/Redis) ‚Üí Using Railway cron + Django signals
- ‚ùå **django-dbbackup** ‚Üí Using Railway PostgreSQL native backups
- ‚ùå **WeasyPrint** ‚Üí Using HTML (not PDF)
- ‚ùå **Paid charting libraries** ‚Üí Chart.js is free & powerful
- ‚ùå **AWS S3** ‚Üí Railway PostgreSQL + email delivery sufficient
- ‚ùå **Plotly** ‚Üí Chart.js sufficient (simpler)
