    "### **Inventory and Production Management**\n- The team decided to automate daily inventory and production tracking to eliminate manual delays and improve accuracy.  \n- **The current manual process causes delays of up to one month in identifying stock deficits like the 20k deficit in Lorina’s stock** (00:00)  \n    - Production data now tracked includes daily mixes, quantities, opening and closing stock, and returns for products like bread and scones.  \n    - The system will allow real-time variance detection within acceptable ranges, such as production between **99 and 105 units** per mix.  \n    - Automating this process will enable immediate alerts on discrepancies, preventing prolonged financial losses.  \n    - This move aligns with **Madame’s** insight that daily stock reconciliation is necessary for operational control.\n- **The system will calculate raw material consumption per mix with detailed ingredient breakdowns, such as 26 kg of flour and 3.8 kg of sugar per scone mix** (02:42)  \n    - Packaging details are included, with packets containing either **4 or 12 units** depending on product type.  \n    - This granularity supports accurate cost tracking and waste reduction.  \n    - Daily raw material stock levels will trigger reorder alerts automatically when thresholds are reached.  \n    - Monitoring diesel consumption, the only frequently purchased stock item, will also be integrated for operational cost control.\n- **Petty cash operations of weekly 5,000 units assigned to the accountant will be integrated into the system as the source of truth** (04:23)  \n    - Role-based access will be implemented for the accountant, product managers, and department heads to input or verify data.  \n    - This structure ensures accountability and reduces the risk of errors or fraud.\n### **Financial Tracking and Profitability Reporting**\n- The organization committed to building a system that calculates daily profit margins and production costs to provide timely financial insights.  \n- **The system will produce daily and weekly profit margin reports for each product, replacing monthly-only tracking that obscures short-term issues** (07:42)  \n    - Profit calculations will factor in ingredient costs, packaging, and selling prices dynamically based on weekly price updates.  \n    - The system will delay report computation until updated prices are entered, ensuring accuracy despite fluctuating raw material costs.  \n    - This approach aims to prevent overspending and capital erosion by providing clear daily financial visibility.  \n    - Sales data will be linked to expected returns and cash collection for reconciliation.\n- **Sales tracking will accommodate cash-based transactions and credit arrangements with schools, ensuring accurate revenue recognition** (21:25)  \n    - Salesmen will input daily sales including zero entries if no sales occurred, helping to track client compliance.  \n    - The system will include commission calculations reflecting discounts like the **5 shillings per bread** given to sales staff.  \n    - Payment tracking will integrate bank and mobile money deposits, with references to transaction codes for audit trails.  \n    - This setup addresses previous losses where up to **90,000 units worth of goods disappeared due to poor dispatch tracking**.\n- **The system will enable clear deficit tracking and cash reconciliation by linking sales, returns, and deposits to specific salesmen and dispatch personnel** (13:51)  \n    - User activity logs and two-factor authentication will secure data entry and improve accountability.  \n    - Discrepancies will trigger system alerts to expedite investigation and resolution.\n### **System Security and User Access Controls**\n- Robust security and user management were prioritized to protect financial data and assign clear responsibilities.  \n- **The system will enforce two-factor authentication and role-based access to restrict sensitive functions to authorized users only** (09:12)  \n    - The accountant, product managers, and department heads will have tailored privileges to input or approve data.  \n    - All user activity will be logged for auditing and fraud detection purposes.  \n    - This approach reflects concerns about past untraceable losses and the need for operational transparency.  \n    - The system will support admin controls for adding or removing users, with **Madame** retaining ultimate control over credentials.\n### **Crate Management and Operational Controls**\n- Tracking and controlling crate inventory was identified as a key operational challenge requiring system automation.  \n- **Crate losses averaging multiple units daily, such as missing 8 crates from an initial 300, have significant cost and operational impact** (10:43)  \n    - The system will include a dedicated crate management module that tracks dispatch, returns, and missing crates in real time.  \n    - Triggers will notify management immediately when crate counts deviate from expected levels.  \n    - This feature addresses a major pain point that previously lacked effective oversight and caused inventory shrinkage.  \n    - Automated alerts will help curb theft and improve asset recovery.\n### **Implementation Approach and Timeline**\n- The team agreed on a phased development plan to build and refine the system iteratively, ensuring smooth adoption and continuous improvement.  \n- **The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will start with digitizing current Excel-based processes into a secure online platform with core daily production, sales, and inventory tracking** (12:20)  \n    - Data entry will initially rely on manual number inputs mimicking existing workflows, easing transition for users.  \n    - Subsequent iterations will add barcode or code generation for invoices and linked payments for enhanced traceability.  \n    - A pilot phase will allow testing and incremental feature enhancements based on user feedback.  \n    - Hosting costs are estimated at **$20 to $30 per month**, with cloud-based access enabling remote monitoring.\n- **The developer will complete the initial user authentication and role management features within the week to enable secure testing** (13:51)  \n    - Mapping of input/output flows and technology architecture will be finalized this week to define clear timelines.  \n    - The accountant and product managers will be involved early as alpha and beta testers to ensure usability and accuracy.  \n    - Ongoing updates will be communicated regularly to keep stakeholders aligned and engaged.  \n    - Training will be organized post-development to ensure smooth onboarding.\n### **Process Improvements and Long-Term Vision**\n- The new system aims to transform operational control from reactive manual checks to proactive, data-driven management.  \n- **Daily automatic reporting will replace slow manual reconciliations, allowing the business to detect issues immediately and optimize cash flow** (07:42)  \n    - This shift supports better spending discipline and timely decision-making aligned with growth goals.  \n    - The system design builds in flexibility to adapt to changing pricing, client arrangements, and product variations.  \n    - Integration of detailed cost tracking per ingredient and product empowers more precise margin management.  \n    - The team envisions continuous refinement as operational learnings surface, with an emphasis on simplicity and reliability.\n- **Sales and dispatch accountability will be strengthened by linking transactions to individual users, reducing losses and improving transparency** (13:51)  \n    - This approach creates clear ownership for inventory and cash, addressing past issues of missing funds and untraceable stock.  \n    - Automated alerts and activity logs will support faster resolution of anomalies.  \n    - The cultural shift toward data discipline is championed by leadership as a core enabler of future scalability.  \n    - The system’s online nature allows real-time oversight from multiple locations, enhancing responsiveness."
