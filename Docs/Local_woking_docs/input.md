REPORT - THE CEO SHOULD GET DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY REPORTS ON FULL 
- i think we need an accounting/finance app too




INPUTS - FORMS FROM ACCOUNTANT 
PREVIOUS DAYS LEFTOVERS - CASH,, STOCK AND PRODUCTS



- ACCOUNTANT WILL ALSO BE FILLING IN INVOICES
- THE ONLY MANUAL THING SHOULD BE DATA ENTRY AND PROCESSING VARIABLES/CONSTANTS
- NO MANUAL COMBING FOR ERRORS OR ISSUES (DEFICITS, OVERSTOCKS, UNSUBMITTED WORK- AUTOMATED DECLINE, NOTIFICATION, ALERTS, ETC - CRITICAL ALERTS SHOULD BE IMMEDIATE
- DATA ORIGINATES FROM PRODUCTION (FILLED BY THE ACCOUNTANT/OPERATIONS MANAGER- THE PRODUCT MIXES, CASH AT HAND, ETC



All right. Let's do a second milestone 2 iteration and a fast check-in of everything that we need to have covered. Now, we've identified that the output for KDF is variable because it's hand-cut, and with a baseline of 100, we can go minus 2 or plus 5. Also note that KDF is not in packets. What I mean is we have pieces or units, which are 12 of them, and then we pack them up to form one packet, which is ideally a dozen. Also, I think we should give an alias to packets of bread to be loaves of bread. And then we should have an "updated by" field in models that allow input/edit. I noticed some of the metadata associated with changes in the products, inventory, and sales doesn't have an "updated by", so let's make sure that we have that. And then the product ingredients, inventory, mixes, etc should be adjustable, so we should have the options to add and remove actual or components of. That means we should have an ingredients table, and maybe it should be in the products or inventory app but I will let you decided on that. What you can determine is that production depends on inventory. Mixes depend on ingredients; which in turn depend on inventory. Sales, on the other hand, depends on production, and this is specifically regarding to expected sales. On the other hand, actual sales will depend on dispatch plus returns. Then, as for the reports and the analytics, they'll have to be pulling data from all the applications. On the other hand, payroll will be connected to accounting and accounts. Then I think we should also come up with categories of reports, but that's to be determined. Then for each and every application, production, products, inventory, sales, payroll, we should show what are the inputs, what and how processing is happening in there, and what are the outputs. And for the inputs, you should classify them as either manual or automated, so that I know what's the app getting from itself and what requires the accountant to key in. As for the inventory app, we need to provide a full ingredients list. Then as for the reorder levels, we need to determine what exactly triggers. Is there a default? Can we adjust that to a custom? Then the CEO wants a profit and loss per mix, so we should be able to pull and display that data. So that he's able to track that as well. Then as for the sales app, we should allow salesmen and the schools to file based on dispatch, so have very strong foreign keys. However, since permissions are inheritable, it means if the salesmen have permission to do that, the accountants also does. And if the accountants does, the admin and the super admin also do. Then as for the currency, let's make sure that the default is Kenyan shillings. Then let's move on to reports. We have three categories of reports as per periods of time. So we have the daily, weekly and monthly. And they should share the same template. The only thing that should have violence is the time period covered. But that structure and the homework should be the same for consistency. The weekly reports should be generated Sunday 8 a.m. The monthly reports the first of every new month. And as for the daily reports, let's bid on that. But I'm guessing if business closes at 6 p.m., we should give a three hour grace period. So let's say close books by 9 p.m. So that the accountant below does not have the ability to edit. And only the CEO, the developer, the super admins can adjust the records. All right. So as I have said, for accountability, we need to close and close the day, the week and the month and store those reports. We also need those to be backed up and tracked. But that's for a version two iteration. Now, the reason I want this report stored and this ideally should have to be in the database, because remember, we are deploying from GitHub, so we don't have right permissions. We only do indeed only. Thankfully, we have a very good Postgre database. So storing reports will prevent overhead when viewing because you generate once and view as many times as you want. Otherwise, we would have to make a new calculation every new time. This will make analytics and graphing much easier and simpler. Not to mention more accountable. So for graphing, I think we should use an extension compatible with Python and Django and make sure that it's free, visually appealing, has contextual colors so that in case we need to display red, we have that option green for success, blue for consistency, and we should have animations, definitely. Then as for the analytics, let's show actual profit and loss and also profit margins and percentages. Then you mentioned we could be generating reports in the form of PDFs, but I think that would be very problematic. So how about we use HTML documents instead? I think that would be perfect, even for sending emails and even for displaying. All right. Now, I also noticed that you're using cerely for cron jobs. However, I'm thinking we can circumvent that so that we avoid implementation complexities, if there are any. So please clarify, because I'm thinking, what if we just use timers with fallbacks? For example, we have been able to successfully say that a cookie will only last that 600 seconds, one hour, and then it expires and you're forced to log in. So why not use the same timers so that it triggers at 9 p.m. or whatever? Just like the cookies in the sessions, instead of adding complexities with Sered. But let me know about that. Then as for recipients of reports, the CEO and developers should get all reports or have access to all reports. Then as for the inputs, make sure we clarify what has to be manually inputted, what is automatically obtained from the database, and which allow for both.

- also - inventory will have a restocking option so that we can add levels
